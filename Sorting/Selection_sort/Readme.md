Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

Worst-case performance О(n2) comparisons, О(n) swaps
Best-case performance О(n2) comparisons, О(n) swaps
Average performance О(n2) comparisons, О(n) swaps
Worst-case space complexity O(1) auxiliary
